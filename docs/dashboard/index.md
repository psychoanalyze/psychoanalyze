## Introduction

Our dashboard is a *[Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)* application. *Dash* is a Python framework for building interactive data dashboards that run in the browser.

While Python developers may be interested in examining or contributing to the code that powers the dashboard, use of the dashboard on our site requires no coding knowledge and aims to be useful to people of all backgrounds.

The dashboard is currently intended to be viewed on a full-sized laptop or desktop monitor and consists of three main panels, one for each column in the interface:

- [Input Panel](input)
- [Visualization Panel](visualization)
- [Output Panel](output)

!!! abstract "On our roadmap:"

    - Responsive styling for mobile devices and tablets
    - Support for customizing the dashboard layout
    - Support for customizing the dashboard theme
    - Streamlit integration
