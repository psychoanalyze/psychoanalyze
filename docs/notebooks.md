# Notebooks

Notebooks are a great way to quickly start scripting with the `psychoanalyze` package without needing to set up a development environment or install prerequisite software.

## Tutorial notebook on Binder

Check out our tutorial notebook to walk through a basic analysis workflow for a hypothetical [yes/no experiment](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/91326/simple-yes-no-question-uncertain-how-to-analyze-the-results).

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/psychoanalyze/notebooks/main?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fpsychoanalyze%252Fnotebooks%26urlpath%3Dlab%252Ftree%252Fnotebooks%252Ftutorial.ipynb%26branch%3Dmain)

## JupyterHub w/GitHub login

We host our own JupyterHub instance on the `nb.psychoanalyze.io` domain. If you'd like to try it out, log in via GitHub with [this link](https://nb.psychoanalyze.io/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpsychoanalyze%2Fnotebooks&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fnotebooks%2Ftutorial.ipynb&branch=main) to spin up your own server.  Your GitHub username will be visible to the maintainers of the project.

## Submit a notebook!

On our roadmap is a gallery of notebooks that demonstrate PsychoAnalyze's functionality. This will be a great way for us to learn how people are using PsychoAnalyze, and for you to share your work with the community.

Please consider submitting a notebook if you have found PsychoAnalyze useful in your research!
