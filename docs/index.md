# Getting Started

- To get an idea of PsychoAnalyze's capabilities, try out the dashboard at [https://psychoanalyze.io](https://psychoanalyze.io). Follow our brief [dashboard guide](dashboard.md), or just start clicking around to see what happens! Try:
    - Simulating data by adjusting model/simulation parameters.
    - Downloading the simulated data in various formats.
    - Upload your own dataset according to the specified schema and observe model fits.
- For more custom applications, you can use `psychoanalyze` [(PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/psychoanalyze/) as a Python package to develop your own analysis scripts. You'll want to check out our [Python API documentation](api.md) and our [test documentation](tests.md).
