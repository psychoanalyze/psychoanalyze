# Notebooks

*Notebooks* are IDE-type environments that allow you to interactively run Python code in the browser, and is a popular tool of choice for researchers and data scientists across many domains.

Common notebook frameworks and environments include [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

PsychoAnalyze provides a couple of notebook features that can be used to explore the package's functionality.

## Tutorial notebook

Check out our tutorial notebook to walk through a basic analysis workflow for a hypothetical [yes/no experiment](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/91326/simple-yes-no-question-uncertain-how-to-analyze-the-results).

- Download the [`.ipynb` file](tutorial.ipynb) and the [tutorial dataset](tutorial_trials.csv).
- View the static version on [GitHub](https://github.com/psychoanalyze/psychoanalyze/blob/main/docs/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb).

## JupyterHub

We provide a ready-to-go, web-hosted notebook on our domain at [https://nb.psychoanalyze.io](https://nb.psychoanalyze.io), powered by JupyterHub. This is a great way to quickly start coding with the `psychoAnalyze` package, without needing to set up a development environment or install prerequisite software.

## Submit a notebook!

On our roadmap is a gallery of notebooks that demonstrate PsychoAnalyze's functionality. This is a great way for us to learn how people are using PsychoAnalyze, and for you to share your work with the community.

Please consider submitting a notebook if you have found PsychoAnalyze useful in your research!
