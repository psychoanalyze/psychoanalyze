## Type Annotations

- Provide type hints for function parameters and return types. Prefer broad (general/wide) types as input and return narrow (specific) types as output.
- Use builtin types and operators for type annotations when possible (e.g., `list[str] | dict[str, int]` instead of `Optional[List[str], Dict[str, int]]). Avoid using `Any` unless absolutely necessary.
- Use ty as the type checker and language server

## Package/Project management
- Use `uv` for all package and project management tasks.

## Linting/Formatting
- Use `ruff` for all linting and formatting needs.
