# Marimo notebook workflow

When editing marimo notebooks, use the marimo MCP tools to guide changes and validate format. The marimo MCP server must be running (e.g. `uv run marimo edit app.py --mcp --no-token`) for these tools to be available.

## Before making changes

1. **Call `get_marimo_rules`** (MCP tool) to load official marimo guidelines and best practices. Use the returned rules and source URL to follow marimo-specific conventions (cell structure, reactivity, `mo.ui` usage, etc.) so edits stay within marimo’s expectations.

## After making changes

2. **Call `lint_notebook`** (MCP tool) to fetch all marimo lint errors for the notebook. Address any reported issues:
   - **Breaking (MB001–MB005)**: unparsable cells, multiple definitions, cycle dependencies, setup-cell dependencies, invalid syntax — fix before considering the edit done.
   - **Runtime (MR001–MR002)**: self-import, branch-expression — resolve to avoid runtime problems.
   - **Formatting (MF001–MF007)**: general formatting, empty cells, markdown indentation, etc. — fix for consistency.

You can also run `marimo check app.py` (and `marimo check app.py --fix` where supported) in the terminal to double-check or auto-fix lint issues.

## Debugging runtime errors

When debugging errors in a running notebook:

1. **Get the session ID first**: Call `get_active_notebooks` with `{"args": {}}` to retrieve the `session_id` for the notebook. This is required for all other debugging tools.

2. **View all errors**: Call `get_notebook_errors` with `{"args": {"session_id": "..."}}` to see runtime errors across all cells.

3. **Inspect specific cells**: Call `get_cell_runtime_data` with `{"args": {"session_id": "...", "cell_id": "..."}}` to see:
   - The actual code being executed
   - Runtime errors with tracebacks
   - **Variable values and types** — invaluable for debugging type mismatches

4. **Find cell IDs**: Cells use short hash IDs (e.g., "Hstk", "Vxnm"), not function names. Call `get_lightweight_cell_map` to find cell IDs by preview content.

### Important: Stale state

The MCP shows state from the **last execution**. If you edit the file but the notebook hasn't re-run the cells:
- Errors and variables will be stale
- The user must manually refresh/re-run the notebook for changes to take effect
- Code shown in `get_cell_runtime_data` reflects file changes, but `variables` and `errors` reflect the last run

### Tool argument format

All MCP tools require arguments wrapped in an `args` object:
```json
{"args": {"session_id": "s_abc123", "cell_id": "Hstk"}}
```

## Summary

- **Guide edits**: Use `get_marimo_rules` before changing the notebook.
- **Validate**: Use `lint_notebook` after changes and fix all reported errors.
- **Debug runtime errors**: Use `get_active_notebooks` → `get_notebook_errors` → `get_cell_runtime_data` workflow.
- Prefer MCP tools when the marimo server is running; use `marimo check` as a fallback or extra check.
