Examine our roadmap to see what we already have planned, and open an issue using the "Feature Request" template to let us know what you need.

## Bug Reports

If you encounter a bug, please open an issue using the "Bug Report" template.

## Developing

If you have experience working in Python, we'd love to have your help developing PsychoAnalyze! See our our page on [environment](environment.md) to set up your environment via Codespaces or otherwise. Familiarize yourself with the [API](api.md) and our [tests](tests.md). Then, consider picking up an [issue](https://github.com/psychoanalyze/psychoanalyze/issues) on GitHub! Write your tests first and get feedback if necessary. Submit a pull request to `main` when you believe a feature is ready to merge.

> Tip: no one's ever made a pull request that was too small and too easy to review 🙂
