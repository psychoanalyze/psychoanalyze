# PsychoAnalyze Python Tutorial / Demo

## Ordinary Least Squares Logistic Regression on Trial Data

### Data Schema

The simplest psychophysical experiments consist of a series of trials measuring a binary-encoded response to an intensity-graded stimulus.

Use the `trials` module to load data from a CSV or Parquet file into a Pandas DataFrame.dd

```{python}
from psychoanalyze.data import trials

example_trials = trials.load("tutorial_trials.csv")
example_trials
```
```{python}
example_trials.info()
```

### Diving into Logistic Regression

By designing the experiment such that the recorded response is binary, researchers may use logistic regression to model the relationship between the stimulus and the response; logistic regression is a generalized linear model that is appropriate for a series of binary (Bernoulli) trials.

Let's examine the logistic function using built-in `psychoanalyze` utility functions.

First, let's plot the standard logistic equation:

```{python}
from psychoanalyze.data.blocks import standard_logistic
from psychoanalyze import plot
import pandas as pd
pd.options.plotting.backend = "plotly"

plot.standard_logistic()
```

::: {.column-margin}
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Sanity check
$f(0) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-0}} = \frac{1}{1+1} = \frac{1}{2}$
:::

### Apply the logistic model to a Yes/No experiment

Let's label some variables and perform some simple substitutions to examine a *non-standard* parameterization of the logistic function, where \mu is a *location* parameter and \sigma is a *scale* parameter:

$$
\psi(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}}}
$$

Observe how the *x-axis* adjusts in response to the following adjustments:

- To the *location* parameter, \mu
```{python}
plot.logistic(location=10, scale=1)
```

- To the *scale* parameter, \sigma
```{python}
plot.logistic(location=0, scale=10)
```
